# NeuralNetwordsAndDeepLearning

This repository is a python 3 implementation of a deep neural network builder which can learn its parameters via Simple Gradient Descent or Stochastic. 

It also contains a loader for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset which can be used to train a deep neural network.

The original code was implement in python 2 as part of the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" book (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and can be found here (https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)
